# Library selection

Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries design to be used with the python programming language. For our purposes we will be concentrating to GUI part of the pygame instead of the sound libraries.

Just like any other language python can use different kind of libraries/packages to create windows, buttons, objects, or slides. Pygame does the similar job but mostly used for game designing purposes. The biggest example of games that have been written with pygame are FlappyBird, Bomberman, TicTacToe, Sudoku, and Pong as shown in our code. 

# Starting to use pygame

Lets take the use of pygame step by step: 

## Step 1: Installation

As anything should start, we need to install the library to use. To accomplish we can use two different ways:
```
pip install pygame
```
or
```
pip3 install pygame
```

I have noticed that the first method did not work when I have tried running my code with it, hence I suggest using the second method to be used.
