# Library selection

Pygame is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries design to be used with the python programming language. For our purposes we will be concentrating to GUI part of the pygame instead of the sound libraries.

Just like any other language python can use different kind of libraries/packages to create windows, buttons, objects, or slides. Pygame does the similar job but mostly used for game designing purposes. The biggest example of games that have been written with pygame are FlappyBird, Bomberman, TicTacToe, Sudoku, and Pong as shown in our code.
