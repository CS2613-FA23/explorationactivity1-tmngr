# ExplorationActivity1
For the first Exploration Activity, python will be the language of the choice. With python there is a library called Pygame, which is a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. It includes computer graphics and sound libraries which can be used to make simple games like Snake, Flappy Bird, and even a simple chess game.

The goal of this code is to use some of the basic functions from this library to make Pong Game. This game containes two players that will move two rectangles in the y-axes to stop the ball from crossing to their side.

## Installation
Before starting with the code, installing pygame is the important step.
To install:
```
pip install pygame
```
or
```
pip3 install pygame
```
## Running the code
Now that the installation of pygame has been completed, time to run the code. The Pong.py code includes everything that is required hence all that is necessary to run the code is to download the .py file and use cmd center or VScode to run it.

Pong.py includes the functions from pygame to create an window, 2 rectangle players that can move in the y-axes and a ball. This simple game that will show us most of the basic functions in the pygame library and it will be a great mix of learning and having fun.

### The examples

Since this is a game that will run by itself on a loop, it does not require any inputs. Of course if any user can change the values of any function that gives sizes, colours, shapes, or speed. 

For output, here are some examples of screenshots of during playing, and end of the game.
